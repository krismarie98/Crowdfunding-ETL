# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Description:
### In this challenge the purpose was to take information on the campaign backers and connect it with the rest of the crowdfunding data. In this project I cleaned and shaped the backers data. Once this was accomplished the next steps were to create a table in SQl and import the data from the file. Using this new table and previous tables I was able to compile two new tables with infomration regarding the remianing goal amounts for campaigns.
